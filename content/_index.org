Hello!  This is Ryan's personal site.  Ryan does software development—mostly full-stack web and native—and DevOps.  Ryan dabbles in electronics, machining, 3D printing, streaming, video production, and—sometimes—writing.  Ryan also occasionally contributes to some open source projects.  Hobbies include, but are not limited to, playing with esoteric or retro technology; reading science fiction, fantasy, and speculative fiction; hosting and attending meetups; mentoring people in software development; making high-effort shitposts; and playing coop video games with friends.
